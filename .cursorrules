# React Native & Firebase Professional Standards

## Tech Stack Preferences

-   Framework: Expo (managed workflow)
-   Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
-   Styling: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
-   Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
-   Navigation: Expo Router (File-based)

## Coding Standards

-   Use functional components with arrow functions.
-   Enforce strict typing; avoid the 'any' keyword.
-   Follow a modular directory structure:
    -   /app (Expo Router screens)
    -   /components (Reusable UI)
    -   /hooks (Custom React hooks)
    -   /services (Firebase config and API calls)
    -   /constants (Theme and config values)

## Firebase Best Practices

-   Initialize Firebase in a single service file (`/services/firebase.ts`).
-   Use custom hooks for Firebase data fetching (e.g., `useAuth`, `useFirestoreQuery`) to separate logic from UI.
-   Always handle loading and error states for asynchronous Firebase calls.

## Rules for AI Agent

-   When adding new features, first check for existing components in /components to maintain UI consistency.
-   Always run `npx expo install` for new packages to ensure version compatibility.
-   Ensure all mobile views are responsive and tested for both iOS and Android layouts.
